# MX-Attrition Dashboard
This is a straightforward dashboard that visualizes metrics from an Excel report related to Attrition Analysis at MX. The case was written by Rupali Chaudhuri, under the guidance of Debapratim Purkayastha at IBS Hyderabad. It was developed based on generalized experience and is intended to serve as a basis for classroom discussion, rather than to demonstrate effective or ineffective management practices.

## The high attrition rate at MX was attributed to various reasons, as highlighted in the case study:
1. Fabricated Employment Experience and Education Certificates: Some employees were found to have fabricated their employment experience and education certificates, leading to concerns about the integrity of the workforce.
2. Safety Incidents and Negative Press Coverage: The company faced negative press coverage due to safety incidents, such as accidents in the production department, which raised concerns about the safety standards at the plant.
3. Maternity Leave and Closure of Children's Crèche: The closure of the onsite children's crèche and the decision to not extend support for employees on maternity leave resulted in the loss of talented female employees, including star performers.
4. Retirement of Senior Managers: Shyam contemplated whether extending the tenure of retired senior managers, such as Anna, could have been beneficial for the organization, especially in roles like heading the Diversity Council.
5. Performance-Based Exits: Employees rated as "Z" performers were asked to leave due to poor performance, reflecting the company's commitment to maintaining performance standards.
6. Strained Relationships with Managers: A significant number of employees left MX due to strained relationships with their managers, indicating potential issues in leadership and communication within the organization.
## After Doing the Analysis
### The analysis revealed that the most common reasons for attrition at MX were:
1. Strained Relationships with Managers: Employees leaving due to strained relationships with their managers indicate potential issues in leadership and communication within the organization.
2. Poor Performance: Employees rated as "Z" performers and asked to leave due to poor performance highlight the company's commitment to maintaining performance standards.
3. Better Opportunities Elsewhere: Some employees may have left MX for better career prospects or opportunities available outside the organization.
4. Not Returning After Pregnancy: The loss of talented female employees who did not return after maternity leave suggests a need for better support and retention strategies for women employees.
5. Job Dissatisfaction: Employees leaving due to job dissatisfaction may indicate underlying issues with work culture, job roles, or organizational practices.
6. Employees Leaving to Work Abroad for the Same Company: Some employees may have chosen to work abroad for the same company, possibly for career advancement or international exposure.
